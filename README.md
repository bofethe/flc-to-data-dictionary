# Feature Layer Collection to Data Dictionary
This script takes an ArcGIS Online item ID and exports a data dictionary for feature layers it contains.

## How to Use
This was written using the default ArcGIS Pro 3.3 `arcgispro-py3` environment. To use this, update lines 68 ad 69 in [main.py](main.py) with the item ID from AGOL (**required**) and the directory you wish to output to export to (*optional*: default is the current directory) and save your edits.
